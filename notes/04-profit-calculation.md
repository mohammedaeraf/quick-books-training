## Profit Calculation in QuickBooks

### üåü How It Works in QuickBooks Online:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Inventory Items**

* When you add a **Product/Service** as an **Inventory Item**, QuickBooks prompts you to enter:

  * **Sales Price / Rate** (Selling Price)
  * **Cost** (Cost Price)
  * **Quantity on Hand**

üìä Example:

| Item Name | Cost Price | Sales Price |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Laptop    | 500 AED    | 800 AED     |

When you sell the item through an invoice or sales receipt, QuickBooks uses this information to:

* Calculate **Gross Profit** = Sales Price ‚Äì Cost Price.
* Track inventory valuation over time.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Non-Inventory Items & Services**

* For **Non-Inventory** and **Service Items**, there is usually **no Cost Price field by default**.

  * These are primarily used when you don‚Äôt track stock or detailed profitability.
  * But you can manually track costs using custom fields or by recording purchases as separate expense transactions.

üëâ In QuickBooks Online, Profit Calculation works best when using **Inventory Items** where both cost and sales price are tracked.

### ‚úÖ Why Cost Price Matters:

* üìä Profit = Sales Price ‚Äì Cost Price
* Without a Cost Price, QuickBooks cannot automatically calculate profit per item.
* Reporting such as **Sales vs Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** will remain incomplete unless Cost Price is entered.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice

* ‚úîÔ∏è For businesses selling physical products and wanting to track profit, always use **Inventory Items** and fill in the Cost Price.
* ‚úîÔ∏è For freelancers or service providers, track expenses separately rather than relying on the product/service form for profit calculation.
